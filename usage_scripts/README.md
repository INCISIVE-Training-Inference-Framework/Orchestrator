This directory contains an example bash script for performing each of the use cases of the Orchestrator component. Notice the existence of a global variable, the hostname of the Orchestrator service.

There are two directories with the following contents:
- scheam: it contains the bash scripts for the Schema use cases
- execution: it contains the bash scripts for the Execution use cases

Use bash from the parent directories (not this root directory) for running the multiple scripts.
